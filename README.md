# World History Quiz

## Project Description
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a quiz (topic of my choice) that required the user to answer a series of questions. When the user presses the start quiz button, the first question displays and a countdown timer starts. For every correct answer, 5 seconds are added to the timer. For every incorrect answer, 5 seconds are deducted from the timer. Once either the timer runs out or the user has answered all of the questions, the final score (the remaining time on the timer) is presented.

### Table of Contents

#### Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

#### Processes
* I built an object containing an array of smaller objects that contained the questions, the answer options, and the correct answer.
* Created variables for the timer and index functions.
* Created event listeners connected to the answer buttons that pull the index number from each object.
* Created conditional that adds 5 seconds for every right answer or subtracts 5 seconds for every wrong answer.
* Created function that starts the timer as soon as the start quiz button is clicked.
